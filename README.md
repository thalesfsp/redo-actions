## Abstraction

A basic implementation of the redo algorithm using array to store/manipulate (in memory - very fast) sequential data, also persisting into the localstorage (with graceful degradation). This version is storing only text, but it can store **any** data structure including all seven data types supported in JS (Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6) and Object), complex structures such as array of arrays and JSON. This idea came after a question in a SAP interview.
